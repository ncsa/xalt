# This "table" is use to filter executables by their path
# The value on the left is either KEEP or SKIP.  If the value
# is KEEP then if the path matches the regular expression then
# the executable is acceptable as far as the path test goes.
# If the value on the left is SKIP then if the path matches
# the regular expression then executable is not acceptable so
# no XALT tracking is done for that path.

# This "table" is used to generate a flex routine that processes
# the paths. So the regular express must follow flex rules.
# In particular, in order to match the pattern must match the whole path
# No partial matches allowed.  Also do not use $ to match the
# end of the string.  Finally slash is a special character and must
# be quoted with a backslash.

# The path are conceptionally matched from the first regular
# expression to the last.  Once a match is found no other later
# matches are checked. The upshot of this is that if you want to
# track say /usr/bin/ddt, but ignore everything in /usr, then keep
# /usr/bin/ddt first and skip /usr/.* after.

# If a path does not match any patterns it is marked as KEEP.

# Programs like R, MATLAB and python* are marked as PKGS.  These programs
# can optionally track the internal "import" that are used.

# XALT samples almost all  executions (both MPI and scalar) 
# based on this table below.  Note that an MPI execution is where
# the number of tasks is greater than 1.  There is no check to
# see if there are MPI libraries in the executable.  Note that
# the number of tasks are MPI tasks not threads.

# Any time there are a number of short rapid executions these
# have to be sampled. However, there are MPI executions with large
# number of tasks that are always recorded.  This is to allow the
# tracking of long running MPI tasks that never produce an end
# record. By default MPI_ALWAYS_RECORD = 1.  Namely that all MPI 
# tasks are recorded.

# The array of array used by interval_array has the following
# structure:
#
#   interval_array = [
#                     [ t_0,     probability_0],
#                     [ t_1,     probability_1],
#                     ...
#                     [ t_n,     probability_n],
#                     [ 1.0e308, 1.0],
#
#
# The first number is the left edge of the time range.  The
# second number is the probability of being sampled. Where a
# probability of 1.0 means a 100% chance of being recorded and a
# value of 0.01 means a 1% chance of being recorded.
#
# So a table that looks like this:
#     interval_array = [
#                       [ 0.0,                0.0001 ],

#                       [ sys.float_info.max, 1.0    ]
#     ]
#
# would say that program with execution time that is between
# 0.0 and 300.0 seconds has a 0.01% chance of being recorded.
# Execution times between 300.0 and 600.0 seconds have a 1%
# chance of being recorded and and programs that take longer
# than 600 seconds will always be recorded.
#
# The absolute minimum table would look like:
#
#     interval_array = [
#                       [ 0.0,                1.0 ],
#                       [ sys.float_info.max, 1.0 ]

# Note that scalar execution only uses this table IFF
# $XALT_SAMPLING equals yes

# XALT filter environment variables.  Those variables
# which pass through the filter are save in an SQL table that is
# searchable via sql commands.  The environment variables are passed
# to this filter routine as:
#
#      env_key=env_value
#
# So the regular expression patterns must match the whole string.


# The value on the left is either KEEP or SKIP.  If the value
# is KEEP then if the environment string matches the regular
# expression then the variable is stored. If the value on the left
# is SKIP then if the variable matches it is not stored.

# Order of the list matters.  The first match is used even if a
# later pattern would also match.  The upshot is that special pattern
# matches should appear first and general ones later.

# If the environment string does not match any pattern then it is
